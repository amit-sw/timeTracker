# Testing Requirements

## Scope
Describe what needs coverage (core timer logic, API endpoints, UI-critical flows).

## Frameworks
- `pytest` for unit and integration tests

## Conventions
- Files named `test_*.py`
- Prefer deterministic tests with isolated fixtures

## Coverage Goals
Set a target (e.g., 80% overall, 90% for `src/core/`).
